// Arcball orbit camera — quaternion-based rotation, no gimbal lock.
//
// The camera orbits around a `target` point using a unit quaternion (`rotation`)
// that maps the canonical "camera looks down -Z" pose to the current view.
//
// Pan:       translates `target` in the view-plane (no rotation change).
// Orbit:     updates `rotation` via arcball delta — converts screen drag delta
//            to a rotation axis/angle, then pre-multiplies the current quaternion.
// Zoom:      adjusts `distance` (exponential feel).
// Snap:      directly assigns yaw+pitch encoded as a quaternion (for ViewCube).
//
// Coordinate convention: Z-up world space (same as the rest of OpenCADStudio).
